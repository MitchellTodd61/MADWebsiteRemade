        <h3>Is the workload heavy and/or difficult?</h3><br/>
        Becoming a Mobile App Developer is an incredibly rewarding career choice, but it comes with many challenges. Computer programming and interface design for mobile are difficult skills to learn and require many hours of practice and devotion. You will spend many hours each week coding and testing your applications. A PASSION for programming is required. This program requires full-time availability. You will be expected to spend 30-40 hours per week working on assignments. There are a number of languages, platforms, vendors, and tools to learn. But remember, a hard work ethic, a commitment to learning, and a passion for creating apps will bring success.
